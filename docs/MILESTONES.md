# MVP Acceptance Tracker

This tracker describes the supported FastAPI Backbone MVP. A checkbox means the criterion has been verified; implementation alone is not verification.

## Product scope

**Included:** FastAPI, Pydantic/Pydantic Settings, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic, PostgreSQL, optional JWT identity, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes/Kustomize.

**Excluded:** PydanticAI, AI agents/providers, Flutter/mobile clients, frontend, project generator/CLI, and product-specific business modules.

## M1 — Application foundation

**Status: complete and verified.**

- [x] Python src-layout package and application factory.
- [x] Development, test, and production configuration profiles.
- [x] Pydantic Settings validation and environment overrides.
- [x] FastAPI exception handling and stable error envelope.
- [x] Request correlation IDs in middleware and response headers.
- [x] Structured logging.
- [x] Explicit CORS configuration.
- [x] Liveness and database-backed readiness endpoints.
- [x] Deterministic application lifespan and engine disposal.

## M2 — Persistence and migrations

**Status: complete and verified.**

- [x] Async SQLAlchemy 2.x engine and session factory.
- [x] PostgreSQL/asyncpg production driver.
- [x] SQLite/aiosqlite development and test driver.
- [x] Transaction-scoped session helper.
- [x] Explicit Unit of Work transaction boundary.
- [x] Async Alembic environment.
- [x] Versioned foundation and identity migrations.
- [x] Migration upgrade/downgrade integration tests.
- [x] PostgreSQL integration test in CI.
- [x] Explicit migration-before-rollout deployment contract.

## M3 — Optional identity and JWT

**Status: implemented and verified; consumers must explicitly configure it.**

- [x] Password hashing with Argon2.
- [x] Generic invalid-credential behavior.
- [x] Signed JWT access and refresh tokens.
- [x] Token expiration, subject, and token-type validation.
- [x] Refresh-token persistence, rotation, replay rejection, and revocation.
- [x] Registration, login, refresh, and logout HTTP endpoints.
- [x] Structured authentication audit events.
- [x] SQLAlchemy identity repositories and composition helper.
- [x] Security regression and integration tests.
- [ ] RBAC/OAuth2 scopes — intentionally excluded from MVP.
- [ ] Built-in rate limiting — intentionally excluded; apply at the edge or in the consuming application.

Authentication remains optional at the composition root. Production applications must provide high-entropy signing secrets and deliberate token lifetimes.

## M4 — Docker and local development

**Status: complete and verified.**

- [x] Locked dependency installation using uv.lock.
- [x] Non-root runtime container.
- [x] Production Dockerfile.
- [x] PostgreSQL-backed development Compose stack.
- [x] Container health check.
- [x] Production Compose definition with external database credentials.
- [x] Explicit one-shot Alembic migration before API startup.
- [x] Docker smoke-test script.
- [x] Docker smoke test passes on the release branch.

## M5 — Kubernetes deployment

**Status: complete and verified.**

- [x] Canonical Kustomize base under k8s/base.
- [x] API Deployment and ClusterIP Service.
- [x] ConfigMap and non-committed Secret example.
- [x] Liveness and readiness probes.
- [x] Resource requests and limits.
- [x] Explicit migration Job.
- [x] Production overlay and migration overlay.
- [x] Optional Ingress example.
- [x] Optional HPA overlay.
- [x] Rollout and rollback instructions.
- [x] Production, migration, and HPA overlays render successfully in CI.

## M6 — Release verification

**Status: complete and verified on the release candidate commit.**

- [x] Ruff passes.
- [x] Mypy passes with no application errors.
- [x] Full test suite passes on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- [x] PostgreSQL integration and migration tests pass.
- [x] Package build and Twine validation pass.
- [x] Docker smoke test passes.
- [x] Production, migration, and HPA Kustomize overlays render successfully.
- [x] Secret scanning and dependency security workflows pass.
- [x] Documentation commands match the actual repository.
- [x] No PydanticAI, Flutter, or stale duplicate Kubernetes implementation remains.

## MVP release definition

The MVP is ready for release when every M6 gate is green on the release commit. The release candidate CI run passed all test matrices, package checks, Docker smoke, Kubernetes rendering, secret scanning, and dependency audit.

The MVP does not promise that every consuming application is automatically production-secure. Applications must still configure secrets, TLS, database access, CORS, backups, monitoring, rate limits, and authorization policy for their deployment environment.

## Change control

Keep this project backend-focused. New features must not expand the MVP silently. PydanticAI, Flutter, frontend work, generators, RBAC, and observability extensions require a separate decision and acceptance criteria.
